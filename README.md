# Rock, Paper, Scissors


## Description

Taking inspo from the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I have created this game as my take on a battle of Human vs Computer. Built using pure vanilla Javascript and CSS, the user is able to select their choice, whilst being shown the computers choice and a tally of the scores being displayed at the bottom. There is no time limit to the game, so the user is free to play as many times as they please!
